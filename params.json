ThreadPool will create these threads when your application starts and let them wait for commands. Give ThreadPool a function and some arguments and it will run on one of your Threads instantly.\r\n\r\n```coffee-script\r\n{ThreadPool} = require 'thread'\r\n\r\n# 4 is the number of threads in the pool\r\n# This defaults to the number of CPU cores you have\r\npool = new ThreadPool 4\r\n\r\ntask = (name, cb) -> \r\n  cb \"Hey #{name}!\"\r\n\r\npool.run task, \"Tony\", (msg) ->\r\n  console.log msg\r\n\r\npool.run task, \"Mike\", (msg) ->\r\n  console.log msg\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nYou can view more examples in the [example folder.](https://github.com/wearefractal/thread/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\n(MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Fractal <contact@wearefractal.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
